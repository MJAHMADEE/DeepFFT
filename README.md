# DeepFFT
PyTorch FFT implementation for version 0.3 (before the built-in torch.fft was released in PyTorch 0.4) and experiment in the Fourier 
domain with Deep Learning architectures for classifications tasks revolving around sequences, such as Video Action Recognition and 
Virtual Machines Classification.

## Requirements
+ Python 3.x
+ Pytorch
+ Anaconda packages
